flush This is a short example of using the barebones `mini` wordset to create and use a new function

here load               flush Gets the current asselmbly pointer
impl_procedure assemble flush Assembles in a pointer to the shared procedure machine code fragment
begin                   flush Begins assembling
    banner              flush This is the startup banner used by the interpreter
    print
    return              flush An explicit return is needed
end                     flush Exit the assembler
invoke                  flush Invoke the pointer left on the stack
